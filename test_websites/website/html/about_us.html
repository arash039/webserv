	<h2>Look at us</h2>
	<a href="#"></a>
	<p>Beautiful picture of our Gang</p>
	<p>We are a trio of motivated and talented software engineers driven by our purpose to have a positive impact on the world and on other people.<br>
	The trio is composed of Arash(ashojach), Leon(lgrimmei) and Henri(helauren).<br>
	Scroll down in order to dive into a deep description of each one of them</p>
	<h3 class="person">Arash</h3>
	<p>
		Arash is a reknowned researcher, probably the only one of the three that has a decent amount of professional success, compared to him Leon and Henri are still babies.
		Arash has studied social sciences and has conducted research in a wide range of fields, not being limited to social science, most of his research was work for the European 
		Union. This sounds like Arash has a beautiful and happy life but no, let's not kid ourselves. He is sick of conducting useless studies for the European Union which is why 
		he left his 6 figure job to become a jobless student again at 42. Not only did he leave his job for 42 a coding school, he doesn't like coding and has said himself
		that he doesn't want to work as a software engineer, so hopefully one die this bloke will stop pursuing things he hates and maybe find a passion. Arrgh "passion" that 
		sounds so cheesy, at least let's hope he doesn't pursue something that he hates doing.
	</p>
	<h3 class="person">Leon</h3>
	<p>
		On the right you will find a beautiful picture of Leon, showcasing the graciousness of his personality. His hand gesture which symbolises an act that adults may perform
		during love making is a true testament of what a mature and adorable boy he was at the age of 12.
		Having worked for a few years as a business developer, Leon just like Arash realised that he hated his job. Now, if you ask him if he likes coding he will tell you that
		he loves it, but if you sit next to him while he codes, you will notice that he is always complaining, and getting mad at his code because it doesn't work! So, Leon's
		conception of love can be difficult to understand, perhaps he is trauma bonding, I mean it is someone that got bullied.
		But all is not dark for our little Leon, as once on MDMA in a Berlin club, he experienced love like never before, it was as if the inner light in him, got turned back on 
		for the duration of the night, giving him hope again after seeing that love exists in this world.
	</p>
	<h3 class="person">Henri</h3>
	<p>
		Henri like Leon did a bachelor in International Business, after obtaining his degree he decided to pursue his passion, what a beautiful thing to do right ? it must be 
		better than to do a job you hate like Arash and Leon did. Well it's what he did, and it's exactly what brought him to 42.. because studying Music Management doesn't get 
		you anywere in life, it only sounds good on a tik tok!
