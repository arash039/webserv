			<p>The above is a beautiful picture of our Gang aka "Die Mannschaft"<br><br></p>
			<p>We are a trio of motivated and talented software engineers driven by our purpose to have a positive impact on the world and on other people.<br>
			The trio is composed of Arash(ashojach), Leon(lgrimmei) and Henri(helauren).<br>

			<h3 class="person_title">Arash</h3>
			<p>
				Arash is a reknowned researcher, probably the only one of the three that has a decent amount of professional success, compared to him Leon and Henri are still babies.
				Arash has studied social sciences and has conducted research in a wide range of fields, not being limited to social science, most of his research was work for the European 
				Union. This sounds like Arash has a beautiful and happy life but no, let's not kid ourselves. He is sick of conducting useless studies for the European Union which is why 
				he left his 6 figure job to become a jobless student again at 42. Not only did he leave his job for 42 a coding school, he doesn't like coding and has said himself
				that he doesn't want to work as a software engineer, so hopefully one die this bloke will stop pursuing things he hates and maybe find a passion. Arrgh "passion" that 
				sounds so cheesy, at least let's hope he doesn't pursue something that he hates doing.

			<img id="Leon" src="./img/Leon.jpg" alt="Leon">
			<h3 class="person_title">Leon</h3>
			<p>
				On the right you will find a beautiful picture of Leon, showcasing the graciousness of his personality. His hand gesture which symbolises an act that adults may perform
				during love making is a true testament of what a mature and adorable boy he was at the age of 12.
				Having worked for a few years as a business developer, Leon just like Arash realised that he hated his job. Now, if you ask him if he likes coding he will tell you that
				he loves it, but if you sit next to him while he codes, you will notice that he is always complaining, and getting mad at his code because it doesn't work! So, Leon's
				conception of love can be difficult to understand, perhaps he is trauma bonding, I mean it is someone that got bullied.
				But all is not dark for our little Leon, as once on MDMA in a Berlin club, he experienced love like never before, it was as if the inner light in him, got turned back on 
				for the duration of the night, giving him hope again after seeing that love exists in this world.

		<div class="person_box">
			<img id="Henri" src="./img/Henri.jpg" alt="Henri">
			<h3 class="person_title">Henri</h3>
			<p>
				Henri, just like Leon, got a bachelor's degree in International Business. After getting his degree, he decided to go after what he really loves, which is great, 
				isn't it? It's got to be better than sticking with a job you can't stand, like what happened to Arash and Leon. Henri decided to study Music Management, which 
				sounds cool but in real life doesn't get you anywhere, so in the end he joined 42, to save his career.
				Henri is pretty good at looking like he knows what he's talking about, just like those TikTok influencers who act like experts but actually have no idea. His 
				carnivore diet is a perfect example; he won't touch vegetables, acting like a little kid who won't eat his peas. He might want to think about changing his eating 
				habits, because his right arm has been hurting for a long time. Eating better could help his body get what it needs to fix itself. And by the way, we all know 
				where that arm injury came from… Also Henri was born in Karlsruhe, to swabians this is also known as the ghetto of Baden-Württemberg.
